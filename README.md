# SunVisualizer
Simple sun rays by time given facade geometry in Unity

SETUP
-----
  1. Install Unity https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
  2. Press play on the top of the screen
  
NEW GEOMETRY
------------
  1. Generate a new geometry
  2. Export the geometry to .obj and import it into unity (Make sure to have surfaces facing both sides since Unity only renders one side of the geometry. i.e. copy, paste, flip)
  3. Drag the geometry file from the 'Project' tab straight into the 'Hierarchy' so that it is placed in the same location
  
NOTE
----
  1. I'm not totally sure that the sun rays are correct given different longitudes/latitudes. The reference I followed was from NOAA Global Monitoring Division's General Solar Position Calculations
 seen in 'solareqns.pdf'
